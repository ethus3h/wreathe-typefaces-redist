1 FONTLOG for ZH Mono
This file provides detailed information on the ZH Mono Font Software. 
This information should be distributed along with the ZH Mono fonts 
and any derivative works.

2  Basic Font Information
This font was created because of the lack of existing fonts containing 
Inscriptional Pahlavi (phli) glyphs. 
All glyphs have the same width. Each stroke has a width of one ninth the width 
of the glyph.
