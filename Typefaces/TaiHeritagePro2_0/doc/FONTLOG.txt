Tai Heritage Pro
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Tai Heritage Pro font. This information should be distributed along with the Tai Heritage Pro font and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------
The original Tai Heritage was designed to reflect the traditional hand-written style of the Tai Viet script that is treasured by the Tai people of Vietnam. This gives it its angular style and flowing lines, as opposed to the more rounded style used by Lao and some modern versions of Tai Viet.

The current Tai Heritage Pro release is Unicode encoded, based on the upcoming Unicode 5.2 standard. It uses the SIL Graphite technology for correct placement of combining marks (vowels and tones).
