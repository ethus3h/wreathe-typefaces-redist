- Tai Heritage Pro Release 2.0 11 August 2009
=========================================================

Thank you for your interest in Tai Heritage Pro. This release represents a major upgrade to the original Tai Heritage font, incorporating Unicode encoding and Graphite technology for correctly positioning the vowel and tone marks of the Tai Viet script. See FONTLOG.txt and TaiHeritageProFontFeatures.pdf for more information about the font.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Since this font depends on Graphite rendering for the correct placement of combining marks, it must be used with Graphite enabled software. See http://scripts.sil.org/GraphiteFAQ "What applications support Graphite?"


INSTALLATION
------------
  - Run the font installer EXE, or 
  - drag the .ttf file onto the Fonts folder icon.
