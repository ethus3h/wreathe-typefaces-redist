DESCRIPTION

The OPENTYPE FONT "Ahuramazda.ttf" is the work of Ernst Tremel
and is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
See license.txt for the full text of the license.

Its glyphs are made concerning all the Avestan Characters in Unicode 
Version 5.2. (Range U+10B00 to U+10B3F) and some of the Inscriptional 
Pahlavi Characters in Unicode Version 5.2. (i.e. U+10B78 to U+10B7F).

It was necessary to allocate some Avestan Conjunct Characters to the
Private Use Area (i.e. <93>AHE<94> to U+E100, <93>SHEA<94> to U+E101,
<93>SHECE<94> to U+E102 and <93>SHETE<94> to U+103) to get them
integrated into the font.

"Ahuramazda.ttf" now consists of all glyphs to display Avestan in its 
own scripture.
